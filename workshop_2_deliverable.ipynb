        "\n",
        "1. **Understand the importance of Data Preprocessing Techniques**: Understanding thes significance of data preprocessing in the data science workflow. This includes to be able to apply common techniques such as cleaning, normalization, transformation, and reduction of data. This also includes handling missing data, outliers, skewed data, and data with different scales.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Familiarize with Data Pre-processing Techniques**: such as feature scaling, dimensionality reduction, and feature engineering.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Apply data pre-processing techniques**: This involved the practical application of data preprocessing techniques to real-world datasets and to be able to evaluate the impact of different preprocessing techniques on machine learning model performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Be aware of the potential biases that can be introduced in data preprocessing, and how to identify and mitigate them.\n",
        "Throughout the workshop, participants will engage in hands-on activities, case studies, and real-world examples. They will work in groups to apply the concepts learned to real datasets, and engage in discussions to share their experiences and insights. By the end of the workshop, participants should have gained a solid understanding of data preprocessing techniques and their importance in the data science workflow, and be able to apply these techniques to improve the performance of machine learning models."
